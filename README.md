Breast Cancer Prediction using NaÃ¯ve Bayes

This project is based on the Breast Cancer dataset, where I have built a Machine Learning model using the NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithm.
The goal is to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

ðŸ”¹ Project Workflow

Dataset: Used the Breast Cancer dataset (from sklearn / Kaggle).

Preprocessing:

Cleaned the data.

Handled missing values (if any).

Split dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Building:

Applied the NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithm for classification.

Model Evaluation:

Tested the model on unseen data (testing set).

Verified that the model performs well.

ðŸ”¹ Algorithm Used

NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier:
A simple yet powerful classification algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem with an assumption of independence between features.

ðŸ”¹ Results

The model was trained and tested successfully.

Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score) show that the model is working properly.


Conclusion

This project demonstrates how NaÃ¯ve Bayes can be effectively used for Breast Cancer classification.
The model was tested on real data and provides reliable predictions.
